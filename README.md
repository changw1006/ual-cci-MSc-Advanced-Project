## **Introduction**

A motion sensing painting program - Collecting Feelings.
People's hands are set to act as paint brushes and while waving their arms, the device captures the trajectory of their hands so that they can draw the lines they want and can save them. I want every teacher, classmate and friend to leave their feelings about ual and cci, their feelings about the UK etc. and their thoughts about me etc. on this drawing board, my final project.

How to use: Click on start, choose the colour with your palm, make a fist and you are ready to paint. When you are finished you can click save to save your painting.
